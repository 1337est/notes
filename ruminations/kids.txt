Having kids is like going from #1 to #2 for the first time in your life. You will try and get back your #1 status from your kids, but will somehow always come up short. That's because no matter how hard you try, you won't ever feel like enough is enough. Because you want your kids to have everything. Every time you feel accomplished from something you did, you'll look at your kids and know that you will never be able to measure your success the same way again. You will never have enough for them. You will try and give them more, more, and more. You know that they come first, and yet you will always be pursuing life to reach #1 because you still need to take back your #1 status. You want to be able to say you've done everything you can for them. You want to say you're the #1 parent in the world and mean it. You need to rise up. #2 isn't good enough for them. You need to be better. It's a pursuit that's never ending. That's what it's like to have kids.
