A scrolling 2d platforming game where the background is a mirror reflection of the players area/arena. You solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and make allies (inspiration from Hollow Knight) to get to the next area. You start the game learning about the world and mirrors, middle of the game your enter the mirror world (inspiration from LoZ A Link Between Worlds). The mirror version of you looks different (not exactly a true mirror, but maybe a different art style in the mirror that shows some kind of dichotomy of yin/yang).
